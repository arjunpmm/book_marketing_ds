# Book: "Marketing Data Science": Code Examples 

Code and data examples included in the book ["Marketing Data Science: Modeling Techniques in Predictive Analytics with R and Python" by Thomas W. Miller](https://www.amazon.es/dp/B00XANZZ4A/ref=pe_386191_48869971_TE_M1DP).

I am going to use it to learn about Data Science tools for the Marketing sector. Not only I will review its Python scripts but also I will create my own examples and include some modifications.
